Type: Jupyter Notebook Extension
Compatibility: 4.x, 5.x, 6.x
Name: Temporary Variables
Main: jupyter_tempvars.js
Link: https://github.com/bskinn/jupyter-tempvars/
Description: |
  Uses per-cell tag annotations to mark code cells whose contents should be surrounded
  by a tempvars.TempVars context manager, to automatically clear matching variables
  from the notebook namespace both before and after cell execution, to avoid
  the common problem of flaky notebook behavior due to namespace pollution.
